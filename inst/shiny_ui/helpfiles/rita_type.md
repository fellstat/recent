# RITA Type

Two RITA screening procedures are supported. 

**RITA2**: RITA2 screens all treated individuals and all individuals with low viral
load as non-recent regardless of the result of the LAg-Avidity assay. This screening
procedure has been used in past PHIA surveys; however, it does require an additional
external parameter in order to calculate incidence estimates. This parameter is a
curve for the probability that an individual is treated given they were diagnosed t
days ago. Additionally, RITA2 assumes that the FRR is the same for individuals
who were treated in the past, but are no longer on treatment. The degree to
which this is true is unknown.

**RITA3**: RITA3, recommended by [1], screened all previously diagnosed individuals
and all individuals with low viral load as non-recent regardless of the result
of the LAg-Avidity assay.
