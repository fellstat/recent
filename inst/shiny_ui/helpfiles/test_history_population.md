# Testing History Population

Testing history is used to estimate the time from seroconversion to diagnosis curve. This can 
either be done using the testing history among undiagnosed HIV+ cases, or the HIV- population.
From a theoretical standpoint, using the undiagnosed population is the desired option.
However, if it is believed that a large fraction of individuals are misreporting their diagnosis status,
using the HIV- population is an alternative.
