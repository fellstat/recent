# Time Since Last HIV Test

A numeric variable representing the number of days since the last HIV test for each subject. This variable may be missing for those who have never been tested and those who have had a previous positive test.

Values can be logical (TRUE or FALSE), string valued, or numeric (1, 0). The largest value is assumed to indicate TRUE if numeric, and the last value in an alpha-numeric sorting indicates TRUE if it is a character string. Missing values should be encoded as NA in the data.
