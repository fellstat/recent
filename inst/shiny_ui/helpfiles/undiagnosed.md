# Undiagnosed HIV Case

A binary variable representing whether each subject has had a previous HIV+ diagnosis. A subject has had a diagnosis if either they report having been previously diagnosed or are on ARV therapy.

Values can be logical (TRUE or FALSE), string valued, or numeric (1, 0). The largest value is assumed to indicate TRUE if numeric, and the last value in an alpha-numeric sorting indicates TRUE if it is a character string. Missing values should be encoded as NA in the data.
