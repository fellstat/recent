# Reference False Recency Rate

The reference false recency rate is the proportion of untreated, non-AIDS progressed, 
non-elite controller, HIV+ individuals infected more that tau years ago that test 
positive on the LAg-Avidity assay.

While there are several studies that look at the recency rate among untreated long-term individuals,
few exclude those with AIDS and those with low viral loads. The default value of 0.0055 is based on the
work of [1].
